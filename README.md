# RIT-EVT Setup Script
This repository contains a single file with the purpose of setting up an EVT Development Enivornment for a macOS developer. This script was created to streamline the process of installing the basic environment setup for members of the team using macOS.

## Installing
There are three commands needed to download and run the setup script. These commands will work on a blank install of macOS so you should not have any provlems running them.

```
curl -o setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ActuallyTaylor/RIT-EVT-Setup/main/setup.sh
chmod 755 setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
